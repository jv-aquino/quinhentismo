# Quinhentismo 📝
### I took the oportunity of a school project to use the knowledge I acquired in the FCC's Responsive Web Design course to do a web project about the literary movement of the Quinhentismo 📕
### This project took a lot of effort (because pure HTML5 and CSS3 were used throughout), but seeing it done gave me inexplicable satisfaction. I hope you enjoy it!
